# DealOS v1.0.1 Validation Report

Baseline validated on 2026-08-25; public-release documentation and dual-agent compatibility revalidated on 2026-09-01.

## Package validation

- 505 original source skills present unchanged under `skills/source_505/`.
- 12 governed DealOS wrapper skills present.
- 13 n8n workflow JSON files parse successfully.
- YAML/JSON/configuration validation passes via `scripts/validate_package.py`.
- Python modules compile successfully.
- unit tests: `2 passed`.


## v1.0.1 public-release revalidation

- Added `CLAUDE.md` and `USING_WITH_CHATGPT_AND_CLAUDE.md`.
- Updated public GitHub release guidance; no production secrets are included.
- `python scripts/validate_package.py`: PASS.
- `python -m pytest -q`: `2 passed`.
- Existing autonomy and consequential-action gates are unchanged.

## API smoke validation

Validated with an isolated SQLite test database:

- `/health` returns healthy;
- inbound Gmail-style sender `Name <email>` is normalized to the email address;
- inbound reply is linked to the previous outbound deal when a relationship exists;
- `drive_write` is Green/autonomous;
- `signature` is Orange and creates an owner approval;
- duplicate and suppression behavior validated in earlier integration smoke tests;
- Stripe and DocuSign adapters fail closed while disabled;
- private-market scanning fails closed while disabled/unconfigured;
- OpenAI daily/monthly budget configuration is enforced before new model calls and estimated usage is persisted.

## Live-readiness boundary

The package is integration-ready but intentionally contains no live third-party secrets. Before live operation, the owner/admin must complete the credential/OAuth steps in `QUICKSTART.md` and `TOOLING_AND_CONFIGURATION.md`, fill approved business/account facts, and run test sends against controlled addresses.

Final signatures and unrestricted money movement remain human-controlled by default.
