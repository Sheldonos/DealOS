# IBM Patent Architect

This skill provides a structured methodology for transforming raw ideas into defensible, enterprise-grade IBM patent disclosure documents. It ensures that the resulting patents are novel, logically sound, aligned with industry trajectories, and formatted according to IBM's internal standards.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Pivot from Physics to System Integration:** Do not just patent the underlying science or algorithm (which may be prior art). Patent the novel *integration, control mechanism, and orchestration* of those elements within an enterprise architecture.

1. **Explicit Differentiation:** Clearly define how the proposed system differs from existing solutions (e.g., standard reinforcement learning vs. predictive agentic AI).

1. **Solve the Paradox:** Identify the critical bottleneck or paradox in the current state of the art (e.g., PQC latency vs. quantum coherence) and introduce a specific mechanism to solve it (e.g., Predictive Phase-Space Displacement).

1. **Enterprise Readiness:** Ensure the solution maps to a concrete architecture with clear hardware/software interfaces, APIs, and hybrid cloud integration.

## Workflow

When a user shares an idea and requests a patent, follow these sequential steps:

### Step 1: Idea Analysis & Gap Identification

1. **Analyze the core concept:** Understand the technical domain and the problem being solved.

1. **Conduct Prior Art Research:** Use the `search` tool to find existing patents, papers, and news related to the idea.

1. **Identify Vulnerabilities:** Determine where the idea overlaps with prior art or lacks technical depth.

1. **Formulate the "Secret Sauce":** Develop a novel mechanism or integration strategy that overcomes the identified vulnerabilities and solidifies the patent's defensibility.

### Step 2: Architecture & Claim Strategy

1. **Design the Architecture:** Map the solution into a multi-layered enterprise architecture (e.g., Application Layer, Control Plane, Security Fabric, Physical Layer).

1. **Draft the Claim Strategy:** Focus the primary claims on the novel feedback loop, orchestration, or integration mechanism, explicitly disclaiming the non-novel underlying components.

### Step 3: Document Generation

Generate the final patent disclosure document using the exact IBM format provided in the template below.

## Output Template: IBM Patent Disclosure Format
