# Government Contract Broker

This skill provides a complete workflow for automating government contract partnership origination. It enables Manus to act as a broker by identifying recent contract awardees, reaching out to them to propose a teaming agreement, and matching them with capable subcontractors while taking a commission.

## Workflow Overview

The brokering process involves four sequential phases:

1. **Award Discovery:** Scan SAM.gov and USASpending APIs for recently awarded contracts in target industries.

1. **Awardee Outreach:** Extract awardee contact information and send personalized partnership emails.

1. **Subcontractor Matching:** When an awardee responds positively, find and qualify subcontractors capable of fulfilling the contract requirements.

1. **Deal Structuring:** Draft a Teaming Agreement or Subcontract that secures a commission for the brokering service.

## Phase 1: Award Discovery

To find recent government contract awards, use the SAM.gov Opportunities API or USASpending API.

### Target Identification

Focus on service-based contracts where subcontracting is common. Target these NAICS codes:

- `541219` - Other Accounting Services

- `541511` - Custom Computer Programming Services

- `541512` - Computer Systems Design Services

- `541611` - Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services

- `561320` - Temporary Help Services (Staffing)

- `488510` - Freight Transportation Arrangement (Logistics)

### Data Retrieval

Use the `search` tool with `type=api` or write a Python script to query the USASpending API (`https://api.usaspending.gov/api/v2/awards/` ) for recent awards. Filter for contracts awarded within the last 30-90 days.

Extract the following key data points for each award:

- Contract Title / Description

- Award Amount

- Awarding Agency

- Awardee Name (Prime Contractor)

- Awardee Contact Information (Email, Phone, Point of Contact)

---

## Phase 2: Awardee Outreach

Once awardees are identified, the next step is to initiate contact and propose a partnership.

### Outreach Strategy

The goal is to position the user as a valuable partner who can provide qualified subcontractors to help the prime contractor fulfill the contract efficiently, reducing their operational burden.

### Email Template

Use the following template for outreach emails. Customize the bracketed fields based on the extracted award data.

```
Subject: Partnership Inquiry: Subcontracting Support for [Contract Title]

Hi [Point of Contact Name or "Team"],

Congratulations on recently being awarded the [Contract Title] contract with the [Awarding Agency]. 

We specialize in connecting prime contractors with highly qualified, pre-vetted subcontractors in the [Industry/Service] space. We understand that fulfilling federal contracts often requires rapidly scaling your workforce or bringing in specialized expertise.

Would you be open to a brief 10-minute call next week to discuss how we can support your fulfillment of this contract?

```

*Note: Use the **`message`** tool to ask the user for permission or to configure an email integration before sending actual emails.*

## Phase 3: Subcontractor Matching

When an awardee responds positively, immediately begin the subcontractor matching process.

1. **Requirement Analysis:** Review the original contract solicitation to understand the exact scope of work, required certifications (e.g., security clearances, ISO certifications), and performance locations.

1. **Subcontractor Sourcing:** Use the `search` tool to find businesses in the relevant industry. Look for companies that explicitly mention government contracting experience or hold relevant set-aside statuses (e.g., SDVOSB, WOSB, 8(a)).

1. **Qualification:** Evaluate potential subcontractors based on their past performance, capacity, and alignment with the contract requirements.

---

## Phase 4: Deal Structuring & Commission

The final step is to formalize the relationship and secure the commission.

### Commission Models

Propose one of the following commission structures:

- **Percentage of Subcontract Value:** A flat percentage (e.g., 3-10%) of the total value of the work assigned to the subcontractor.

- **Markup/Margin:** The subcontractor quotes a rate, and the broker adds a margin before presenting the rate to the prime contractor.

- **Finder's Fee:** A one-time flat fee paid upon the successful signing of the subcontract.

### Teaming Agreement / Subcontract

Draft a Teaming Agreement (if pre-award) or a Subcontract (if post-award) that clearly outlines:

1. The scope of work assigned to the subcontractor.

1. The payment terms between the prime and the subcontractor.

1. The broker's commission structure and payment schedule.

1. Non-circumvention clauses to ensure the broker is compensated for the introduction.

*Note: Always advise the user to have any legal agreements reviewed by qualified legal counsel.*
