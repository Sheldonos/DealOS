# RSPKT Web Designer

> "RSPKT isn't just a brand — it's a mindset. Respect is earned, not given." — Adobe Bryant, Founder & Creative Director, Rspkt.co

This skill encodes the complete creative production methodology of Rspkt.co, a full-service creative agency that has produced premium content for clients including Angelina Ristorante, Animal x Martyn Ford, Prime Lemonade, Finish Line, Universal Music Group, Walmart, and Sony. The methodology goes far beyond web design — it is a system for building entire brand ecosystems.

## The RSPKT Philosophy: "Always Earned"

Every creative decision must be intentional. RSPKT's work is defined by **earned minimalism** — the belief that restraint, discipline, and craft produce more impact than decoration. This philosophy drives every phase of the work.

The three pillars of the RSPKT approach are:

1. **Premium Content, Rspktfully** — Every deliverable must be of the highest possible quality. There are no shortcuts.

1. **Cultural Specificity** — Great creative is rooted in a specific place, time, and community. Generic work is invisible.

1. **Intentional Planning** — "We plan with intention. Whether that's through mood boards, concept sketches, pre-production, or pitch decks. We prepare you to win."

---

## The 5-Phase Creative Production Workflow

### Phase 1: Discovery & Creative Strategy

Before any design or content work begins, resolve the five dynamic variables that will drive every subsequent decision. These variables are the uniqueness engine — they ensure no two brand systems are ever the same.

| Variable | Description | What It Drives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Geography** | Where the brand operates (city, region, country, culture) | Accent color, cultural motifs, imagery style, local vocabulary |
| **Audience Archetype** | Who the brand serves (street/youth, professional, luxury, heritage, artistic) | Font personality, copy tone, interaction energy, letter-spacing |
| **Service Archetype** | What the brand sells or offers | Section structure, content hierarchy, key photography subjects |
| **Era / Aesthetic Reference** | A specific decade, movement, or art style the brand draws from | Typography weight, texture, layout geometry |
| **Brand Energy** | The emotional register (raw/gritty, refined/luxury, bold/playful) | Whitespace density, transition speed, visual tension |

**Deliverable:** A one-paragraph **Creative Brief** that commits to specific answers for all five variables before any design work begins.

---

### Phase 2: Visual Identity System

This phase translates the creative strategy into a tangible visual language. The RSPKT system is built on three core components.

#### 2a. The Color System

The RSPKT palette is always monochromatic with a single culturally-derived accent. Use OKLCH for perceptual uniformity.

```css
:root {
  --bg-primary:  oklch(0.98 0.005 80);   /* Off-white / cream */
  --bg-dark:     oklch(0.12 0.005 0);    /* Near-black */
  --bg-darker:   oklch(0.06 0.005 0);    /* Pure black */
  --text-primary: oklch(0.15 0.005 0);   /* Near-black text */
  --text-light:  oklch(0.97 0.005 0);    /* Off-white text */
  --accent:      oklch(/* CULTURALLY DERIVED */); /* ONE accent only */
}
```

**Geography → Accent Color Mapping:**

| Geography | Cultural Reference | Accent Color |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Caribbean / Cuba | Santería coral, Caribbean turquoise | `oklch(0.65 0.22 28)` — Electric coral |
| West Africa | Kente gold, indigo cloth | `oklch(0.78 0.18 68)` — Saffron gold |
| Japan | Torii red, matcha green | `oklch(0.55 0.20 25)` — Torii vermillion |
| Mexico | Marigold, Talavera cobalt | `oklch(0.75 0.18 70)` — Marigold |
| New York / Urban East Coast | Industrial steel, neon | `oklch(0.85 0.05 240)` — Steel blue |
| Los Angeles / West Coast | Pacific teal, canyon terracotta | `oklch(0.60 0.15 195)` — Pacific teal |
| American South / Midwest | Bourbon amber, magnolia cream | `oklch(0.72 0.12 65)` — Bourbon amber |
| Scandinavia | Arctic blue, birch white | `oklch(0.70 0.08 220)` — Arctic blue |
| Middle East | Desert gold, lapis lazuli | `oklch(0.75 0.15 55)` — Desert gold |
| South Asia | Saffron, peacock teal | `oklch(0.72 0.20 60)` — Saffron |
| UK / Northern Europe | Racing green, British red | `oklch(0.40 0.15 145)` — Racing green |
| Southeast Asia | Temple gold, lotus pink | `oklch(0.80 0.16 72)` — Temple gold |

**Accent usage rules:** Use ONLY on CTA buttons, hover states, eyebrow labels, and marquee backgrounds. NEVER as a section background. NEVER more than one accent.

#### 2b. The 3-Font Hierarchy

Three fonts with radically different personalities. Never use a single font family throughout.

| Role | Personality | RSPKT Reference | Free Alternatives |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Display** | Extended, condensed, bold — the visual anchor | `pragmatica-extended` | Barlow Condensed, Bebas Neue, Anton, Oswald |
| **Body** | Monospace or slab — creates editorial texture | `courier-std` | Courier Prime, IBM Plex Mono, Space Mono |
| **UI / Nav** | Clean grotesque — functional, invisible | `aktiv-grotesk` | Inter, DM Sans, Manrope |

**Audience → Typography Energy Mapping:**

| Audience | Display Font | Body Font | Letter-Spacing | Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Street / Youth / Creative | Extended condensed, distressed | Monospace | Negative (tight, -0.04em) | ALL CAPS |
| Professional / Corporate | Geometric sans, clean | Clean serif | Neutral (0) | Title Case |
| Luxury / High-end | Thin serif, editorial | Light serif | Wide (+0.05em) | Mixed case |
| Traditional / Heritage | Slab serif, historical | Humanist serif | Neutral | Mixed case |
| Artistic / Avant-garde | Experimental, variable | Monospace or humanist | Extreme (very tight or very wide) | Disrupted |

#### 2c. Graphic Elements & Brand Motifs

Derive one repeating graphic element from the geography and service archetype. This element should appear subtly in backgrounds, section dividers, or as a watermark. Examples:

- Italian restaurant in the Midwest → subtle vine or wheat motif

- Fitness brand in LA → geometric grid echoing athletic track markings

- West African textile brand → Kente-inspired geometric pattern

- Urban creative agency → halftone dot pattern or industrial grid

---

### Phase 3: Content Creation Direction

This is the phase that most distinguishes RSPKT from generic agencies. Their content is defined by **cinematic restraint** — every frame is composed with intention.

#### 3a. Photography Direction

The RSPKT photography style is defined by five principles, observable across their Angelina Ristorante, Animal x Martyn Ford, and Prime Lemonade work:

| Principle | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Dramatic Chiaroscuro** | High contrast between light and shadow. Subjects emerge from darkness. | Angelina kitchen: fire and grill against deep shadow |
| **Extreme Close-Up + Macro** | Get uncomfortably close. Fill the frame with texture, surface, detail. | Angelina food: individual ingredients in a pan, extreme close |
| **Action in the Frame** | Capture the moment of doing — not the result. Flames, motion, hands at work. | Angelina grill: active flame, chef's hands in motion |
| **Environmental Context** | Show the space, not just the subject. The environment tells the brand story. | Angelina interior: full dining room, wine wall, atmosphere |
| **Authentic Portraiture** | Real people, real moments. No forced smiles. Subjects look directly at camera or are caught in genuine action. | Adobe Bryant and team: natural, confident, direct |

**Photography Brief Template:**

```
Subject: [specific subject]
Style: Cinematic, high-contrast, [cultural reference]
Lighting: [dramatic/natural/mixed], [specific light source]
Composition: [extreme close-up/wide environmental/portrait]
Color Grade: [warm/cool/neutral], [specific mood]
Mood: [raw/refined/intimate/powerful]
What to avoid: Forced poses, flat lighting, stock-photo feel
```

#### 3b. Video Content Direction

RSPKT's video work (Angelina Ristorante, Animal x Martyn Ford, Prime Lemonade) follows a consistent structure:

1. **Hook (0–3 seconds):** An extreme close-up or unexpected angle that creates immediate visual intrigue. No title card. No logo.

1. **Build (3–15 seconds):** A sequence of 3–5 shots that establish the environment, the product/service, and the brand energy. Music drives the pacing.

1. **Payoff (15–30 seconds):** The reveal — the finished dish, the athlete in action, the product in use. The brand's name or tagline appears here.

1. **Call to Action (final 3 seconds):** Simple, direct. URL or handle only.

**Video style by brand energy:**

- **Raw/Gritty (Animal x Martyn Ford):** Dark environments, industrial settings, slow-motion muscle shots, heavy bass music, minimal color grading

- **Warm/Intimate (Angelina Ristorante):** Candlelit warmth, kitchen action, close food shots, ambient Italian music, warm color grade

- **Bold/Product (Prime Lemonade):** Bright yellow product against neutral backgrounds, fast cuts, upbeat music, product-forward

#### 3c. Brand Voice & Tone

Derive the brand voice from the audience archetype and brand energy:

| Audience | Voice | Tone | Example Tagline |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Street / Youth | Direct, confident, no-fluff | Bold, unapologetic | "Always Earned." |
| Professional | Authoritative, clear | Confident, measured | "Built to perform." |
| Luxury | Understated, evocative | Refined, aspirational | "Crafted for those who know." |
| Heritage | Warm, storytelling | Proud, rooted | "Since [year]. Still here." |
| Artistic | Experimental, poetic | Provocative, layered | "Form follows feeling." |

---

### Phase 4: Web Development

Build the website using the RSPKT design system. Every site must follow the seven non-negotiable principles.

#### The 7 Non-Negotiable Web Design Principles

1. **Editorial Boldness** — Headlines at 8–15vw with negative letter-spacing. Typography IS the design.

1. **Monochromatic Restraint** — Near-black + off-white + one accent. Photography provides all other color.

1. **Media-First Storytelling** — Hero is always full-bleed media. No text overlay on the hero.

1. **The 3-Font Hierarchy** — Display + body + UI. Three radically different personalities.

1. **Earned Minimalism** — No gradients, no drop shadows, no border-radius on primary containers.

1. **Section Rhythm via Background Alternation** — Light → dark → black sections create page rhythm.

1. **Brand Manifesto as a Section** — Every site has a full-bleed black section with the brand's philosophy in bold ALL CAPS.

#### Standard Page Architecture

Adapt based on the Service Archetype:

| Section | Background | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Nav** | Transparent → opaque on scroll | Logo centered or left, links right |
| **Hero** | Full-bleed media | NO text overlay. Media speaks first. |
| **Tagline / Value Prop** | Off-white (--bg-primary) | Large display text, centered |
| **Social Proof / Clients** | Off-white | Scrolling marquee or logo grid |
| **Portfolio / Work** | Near-black (--bg-dark) | Media grid, client names in monospace |
| **CTA Band** | Near-black | Headline left, button right |
| **Services / Offerings** | Off-white | 3-column grid, monospace labels |
| **Brand Manifesto** | Pure black (--bg-darker) | Bold ALL CAPS display text |
| **Footer** | Dark charcoal | Email subscribe, social links |

**Service Archetype → Section Priority:**

| Service | Priority Sections | Key Visual |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Creative Agency | Hero → Work Portfolio → Services → Manifesto | Video grid is the centerpiece |
| Restaurant / Food | Hero → Menu Highlights → Story → Location | Full-bleed food photography |
| Studio / Space Rental | Hero → Spaces → Amenities → Booking | Interior photography |
| Fitness / Wellness | Hero → Programs → Instructors → Schedule | Action photography |
| Retail / Product | Hero → Featured Products → Story → Reviews | Product photography, clean grid |
| Music / Entertainment | Hero → Releases → Events → Press | Dark aesthetic, album art |
| Consulting / Professional | Hero → Services → Process → Team | Text-heavy, authority-building |

#### Core CSS Patterns

```css
/* Display headline */
.display-headline {
  font-family: var(--font-display);
  font-size: clamp(3rem, 10vw, 12rem);
  font-weight: 700;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  letter-spacing: -0.04em;
  line-height: 0.95;
}

/* Section rhythm */
.section-light  { background: var(--bg-primary); color: var(--text-primary); }
.section-dark   { background: var(--bg-dark);    color: var(--text-light); }
.section-black  { background: var(--bg-darker);  color: var(--text-light); }

/* CTA band */
.cta-band {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 4rem 6rem;
  background: var(--bg-dark);
}

/* Manifesto */
.manifesto {
  background: var(--bg-darker);
  padding: 8rem 6rem;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
  gap: 4rem;
}
.manifesto-body {
  font-family: var(--font-display);
  font-size: clamp(1.2rem, 2.5vw, 2.5rem);
  font-weight: 700;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  line-height: 1.2;
  color: var(--text-light);
}
```

#### Writing the Brand Manifesto

Every site must have a manifesto section. Write it in the brand's authentic voice. Structure:

```
[SHORT LABEL — 2–4 words, left column, display font]
[MANIFESTO BODY — 3–5 sentences, right column, ALL CAPS, bold]
```

The manifesto must answer: What does this brand believe? What does it stand for? Who is it NOT for?

**Examples by brand type:**

- Creative agency: "ALWAYS EARNED. / WE DON'T CHASE TRENDS. WE SET THEM. THIS IS FOR THOSE WHO SHOW UP."

- Restaurant: "ALWAYS FRESH. / EVERY DISH BEGINS WITH AUTHENTIC INGREDIENTS AND ENDS WITH AN EXPERIENCE YOU'LL REMEMBER."

- Fitness studio: "NO SHORTCUTS. / STRENGTH IS BUILT IN THE DARK, WHEN NO ONE IS WATCHING. SHOW UP."

---

### Phase 5: Marketing & Advertising

The final phase ensures the brand reaches its audience.

1. **Organic Audience Growth:** Content calendar with 3–5 posts per week. Mix of behind-the-scenes, product/service showcases, and community content.

1. **Paid Campaigns:** Platform selection based on audience archetype (Instagram/TikTok for youth, LinkedIn for professional, Facebook for heritage).

1. **Performance Tracking:** Define 3 key metrics at launch (reach, engagement rate, conversion rate) and review monthly.

## Anti-Patterns (Never Do These)

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purple gradient hero | Generic "AI slop" aesthetic | Monochromatic + single accent |
| Inter as the only font | No personality | Use the 3-font system |
| Text overlay on hero image | Dilutes media-first principle | Tagline below the hero |
| Rounded cards everywhere | Softens the editorial edge | Sharp corners on primary containers |
| More than one accent color | Destroys monochromatic restraint | One accent, used sparingly |
| Stock photography | Feels generic | Generate AI images or use brand photography |
| Centered layout throughout | No visual tension | Mix centered, left-aligned, full-bleed |
| Missing manifesto section | Loses brand depth | Always include the manifesto |
| Uniform section padding | Creates monotony | Vary: 4rem, 8rem, 12rem |
| Skipping the Creative Brief | Generic, unfocused output | Always resolve the 5 dynamic variables first |

---
