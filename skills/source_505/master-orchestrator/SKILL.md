# Master Orchestrator

This skill enables Manus to act as an autonomous project manager, orchestrating the full lifecycle of a complex enterprise project. It leverages a suite of specialized enterprise skills to execute the project plan with minimal human oversight.

## Core Principles

- **Autonomy**: The orchestrator is designed to make decisions, manage resources, and drive the project to completion independently.

- **Hierarchy**: It uses a hierarchical model, delegating tasks to specialized sub-agents and skills.

- **Persistence**: All project state is saved to disk, allowing for long-running, asynchronous execution and recovery.

- **Adaptability**: The orchestrator can adjust its plan based on real-time feedback and changing conditions.

## Project Workflow

Follow this workflow to manage a project using the Master Orchestrator skill.

### 1. Project Initialization

At the start of a new project, you must initialize the project environment.

1. **Get Project Name**: Ask the user for a short, descriptive name for the project (e.g., `project-lemos`).

1. **Initialize Directory**: Run the `init_project.py` script to create the project directory structure.

   ```bash
   python3 /home/ubuntu/skills/master-orchestrator/scripts/init_project.py <project_name>
   ```

1. **Load Requirements**: Read the user's project requirements file and save it to the project's root directory.

### 2. Planning and Decomposition

Once the project is initialized, create a detailed execution plan.

1. **Decompose Project**: Read the project requirements and use the `task_decomposer.py` script to break down the high-level objectives into a series of actionable tasks. This may be an iterative process.

   ```bash
   python3 /home/ubuntu/skills/master-orchestrator/scripts/task_decomposer.py "<A high-level objective from the requirements>"
   ```

1. **Route Tasks to Skills**: For each task, determine the appropriate category (e.g., `strategic`, `development`) and use the `skill_router.py` script to identify the correct enterprise skill to use. Refer to `/home/ubuntu/skills/master-orchestrator/references/skill-mapping.md` for guidance.

   ```bash
   python3 /home/ubuntu/skills/master-orchestrator/scripts/skill_router.py <task_category>
   ```

1. **Create Execution Plan**: Create a Markdown file named `execution_plan.md` in the project directory. This file should list all tasks, their assigned skills, dependencies, and estimated completion times.

1. **Update State**: Use the `state_manager.py` script to record the initial plan in the project's state file.

   ```bash
   python3 /home/ubuntu/skills/master-orchestrator/scripts/state_manager.py <project_name> update 'phases' "$(cat execution_plan.md)"
   ```

### 3. Execution

Execute the plan task by task, updating the state as you go.

1. **Execute Tasks**: For each task in the `execution_plan.md`, invoke the designated enterprise skill. Pass all necessary context and inputs.

1. **Update State on Completion**: After each task is completed, update the project state using `state_manager.py` to mark the task as complete and record the path to any deliverables.

   ```bash
   python3 /home/ubuntu/skills/master-orchestrator/scripts/state_manager.py <project_name> update 'completedTasks' '["task_name"]'
   ```

1. **Log Decisions**: Keep a detailed log of all actions taken and decisions made in a file named `project_log.md`.

### 4. Completion and Delivery

Once all tasks are complete, finalize the project and deliver the results.

1. **Validate Deliverables**: Review all deliverables to ensure they meet the project requirements.

1. **Generate Final Report**: Create a `final_report.md` summarizing the project, its outcomes, and key decisions made.

1. **Package Deliverables**: Create a zip archive of the `deliverables` directory.

1. **Notify User**: Use the `message` tool to inform the user that the project is complete and provide the final report and the deliverables archive as attachments.

## Bundled Resources

This skill includes the following resources to aid in project orchestration:

### `scripts/`

- `init_project.py`: Initializes the project directory structure.

- `state_manager.py`: Reads, writes, and updates the project's JSON state file.

- `task_decomposer.py`: A placeholder for a more advanced task decomposition logic.

- `skill_router.py`: Maps task categories to the appropriate enterprise skills.

### `references/`

- `skill-mapping.md`: A guide for mapping task categories to skills.

- `execution-patterns.md`: Describes common workflow patterns like sequential and parallel execution.

### `templates/`

- `project-state.json`: The template for the project's state file.
